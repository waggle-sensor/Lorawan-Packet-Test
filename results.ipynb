    "This test was conducted to evaluate our rpi.lorawan compute's lorawan signal distance. Three packet sizes were used (16, 32, 64 bytes). Each packet size was sent in three different data rates (DR1,DR2, DR3). DR0 was not used because the maximum payload size is 11 bytes (in most cases this is too small). The packet with 64 bytes only used DR2 and DR3 since DR1 maximum payload size is 53 bytes. In this test we used lorawan Region US915 MAC version 1.0.2 Regional Parameters revision A. Each combination of payload size and data rate was sent three times. For example, packet with 16 bytes in DR1 was sent three times. \n",

    ">NOTE: Payload sizes more than 80 bytes did not work with the arduino mkrwan 1310. The most likely case of this is because the arduino was not outputting enough power to transmit packets higher than 80 bytes. The lorawan specifications allows more than 80 bytes in spreading factor 8 and 7 so it is possible to send more than 80 bytes if the lorawan device is capable of it.\n",

    "The process involved driving or walking to each location and starting the arduino so that it can join and send packets to the network. The day we performed the test included no rain and slight cloudy sky. It had rain in the morning but not during the test. The landscape is slightly urbanized with some space in between buildings. Look at the final map to see more details of the landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    ">NOTE: The environment plays a huge factor in the range of the lorawan signal, so it is possible for the range to increase if the test is conducted again at a nother location. Since this test was done in an urban area with buildings in between our lorawan sensor and gateway, take this as a middle ground. If your deployment is in a rural area the range will most likely increase. On the other hand, if your deployment is in a more urbanize area (more buildings) than the range will more likely decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our gateway was ~1.24m above the ground. The antenna should have been higher up but we did not have an available tower to deploy our gateway at a higher altitude. Keeping this in mind, the range would have been larger if the antenna was higher up the ground.\n",

    "Looking at the map, anything lower than 1129.8m from the gateway successfully joined and sent packets. If we click into the Device Location markers we can see which sizes did better and in what data rates. For example at a distance 1129.8m away from the gateway, packet size 64 bytes in Spreading Factor 8 (DR2) we lost 1/3 of the packets but in Spreading Factor 7 (DR3) we lost none. Using these results we can get a general sense of how well our rpi.lorawan compute does in range in varying data rates and packet sizes. When looking at this map keep in mind each deployment location can have different results, look at these results do get a general idea of how well the rpi.lorawan does."
